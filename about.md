    <h1>Let's help our community!</h1>

    <p>The global covid19 outbreak presents Australians with new challenges - challenges we’ve never met before. Now more than ever it’s important to buy local and support those businesses dedicated to supporting us.</p>
    <p>Our communities, families, businesses, and relationships have to stick together through the hard yakka of the coming months, and give our all; to ensure our neighbourhood ties, services, and lifestyle survive through these unsure times.</p>
    <p>This page is by- and for- our local communities of Highgate, Northbridge, Mount Lawley, and North Perth; to help protect our love of food, and maintain the joy of eating through these turbulent times.</p>
    <p>It is for businesses and community members alike and, above everything else, is a space to celebrate those Australian values of family, food, and multiculturalism - even when we might not feel like celebrating</p>
